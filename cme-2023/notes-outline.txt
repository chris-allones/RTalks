Why use an SEM

1 Assessment of the measurement error

-  can specify relationship among constructs that are purged of measurement error so that we can get an unbiased estimates of our predictors and outcome variables.

2. Testing the fit of teh model to the data

- test the structure of our model by evaluating its fits to the patterns of association pn our observed data

3. Testing statistical models that more closely align with theory

- can specify complex theoretical structures that are consistent with or conform with to the kind of complicated hypotheses that we often specify.

1 explicit assessment of measurement error
2 estimation of latent (unobserved) variables via observed variables;
3 modeling testing where a structure can be imposed and assessed as to fit of the data
